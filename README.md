# Heroku buildpack for MoonZoon

> [MoonZoon](http://moonzoon.rs/) is a Rust Fullstack Framework.

The current purpose of this buildpack is to make [MoonZoon demo](https://github.com/MoonZoon/demo) work. It means it does only the essential things and nothing more (e.g. caching).

It's tested with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), however there is a chance it works also with a Heroku-like PaaSs like [Dokku](https://dokku.com/).
